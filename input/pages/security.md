### Transport Security

All exchanges in the exchange SHALL use Transport Layer Security (TLS).

- The inbound gateway intermediary SHALL hold the TLS certificate for the destination's public FHIR service base URL
- The destination system and any delegated intermediaries SHALL hold the certificates for their servers' private URLs.

<p></p>

### Trust Determination

In this exchange model, trust is negotiated solely between the originator and destination. The destination SHALL determine whether it trusts the originator or not; any intermediaries involved in the exchange SHALL play a passive, "pass through" role in the process.

Required behavior:

- security tokens generated by the destination for use by the originator SHALL be forwarded by any intermediaries to the originating client
- the payload and token SHALL be signed by the destination and delivered without modification to the originator.

Implementers MAY adopt UDAP workflows for client registration, authentication and authorization as described in the [HL7 / UDAP Security for Scalable Registration, Authentication, and Authorization FHIR Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-udap-security-ig/branches/main/index.html)

### Other Security and Privacy Considerations

Implementers of this guide SHOULD follow core FHIR security principles and protect patient privacy as described in the FHIR Security and Privacy Module.

- The [FHIR Security and Privacy Module](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/secpriv-module.html) provides guidance related to communication security, authentication, authorization/access control, audit, digital signatures, attachments, labels, narrative, and input validation. The FHIR security specification is available [here](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html).
- The [Security and Privacy Module](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/secpriv-module.html) describes how to protect a FHIR server through access control and authorization, how to document what permissions a user has granted, and how to keep records about what events have been performed.
