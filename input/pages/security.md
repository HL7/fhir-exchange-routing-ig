Implementers of this guide SHOULD follow core FHIR security principles and protect patient privacy as described in the FHIR Security and Privacy Module.

- The [FHIR Security and Privacy Module](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/secpriv-module.html) provides guidance related to communication security, authentication, authorization/access control, audit, digital signatures, attachments, labels, narrative, and input validation. The FHIR security specification is available [here](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html).
- The [Security and Privacy Module](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/secpriv-module.html) describes how to protect a FHIR server through access control and authorization, how to document what permissions a user has granted, and how to keep records about what events have been performed.

Further, implementers MAY adopt UDAP workflows for client registration, authentication and authorization as described in the [HL7 / UDAP Security for Scalable Registration, Authentication, and Authorization FHIR Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-udap-security-ig/branches/main/index.html)
